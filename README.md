# sign-up-form
A project completed as part of The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS course.

This project allowed me to practice the implementation and styling of an HTML form. I also practiced adding responsiveness to each element on the page so the layout of the page looks nice on multiple desktop sizes as well as mobile.

Lastly, I used Javascript to check if the password fields match each other and give the user an error message if they do not match.
